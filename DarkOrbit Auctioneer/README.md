This program was created to automate the betting in auctions in popular online game Dark Orbit (darkorbit.com).

The bot uses spiders to crawl the website, gather information and make appropriate bets. 

It required quite a lot of manual tuning to avoid getting into captchas and maximize the earnings by betting at last possible moment.
